# weather-dashboard

The objective of this application is to make full use of third-party APIs by making requests with URLs with specific parameters to the server to retrieve data to present to users.

The specific topic is a weather dashboard that allows users to view the weather forecast of the current day and the next 5 days. They will be able to plan their future events like going to a hike or planning a vacation.

When the user loads the webpage, they are presented with a blank forecast since there is no selected city. To search the weather for a specific city, they are able to click on the input box that is located on the right side. When they search for a city, they are presented with the current day's weather statistics including temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and even a weather icon. They are also presented with the temperature, humidity, and weather icon of the next 5 days after the current day. The UV index is color-coded to have its background color change depending on the UV index scale. UV index between 0 and 3 will display a green background, between 3 and 8 will display a orange background, and a number above 8 will have a red background. The user will also be able to see a list of previously searched cities. They can click on any item on the list to view that city's current and future days displayed on the screen.
